### About me
I'm 28 years old. I was a doctor, but one day I realized that I do not love my work. 
Steve Jobs said: 
> The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.
 
So I decided to change my life and became a front-end developer. I'm interested in quick and intensive start of my new life.
